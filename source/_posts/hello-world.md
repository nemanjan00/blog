title: Hello World
---
## Small talk... 
First of all I want to welcome all of you to this journey through my life. 
First of all **I am a men, just like most of you** (I am really sorry if you are a nasty bot crawling my website) and I want you guys to think of me that way. So, what I want to tell you guys is that **if I am better than you in something, do not try to find any excuses** not to accomplish what I did. 
Sometimes you just have to **fucking do it**. 

## How we all become what we are? 
As a kid, I spent most of my time **disassemblyng everything I could get my hands on**. Don't you guys think **that is the best feeling ever**? **Knowing how something works** and potentially being able to **make it do something even better than what it was made for**? Well, I do and that's how it all started. 

## How I emerged from it? 
When you start realizing what you love, **there is just not too much to think about**. With a time you just start analyzing everything and understanding how **everything works even beyond your boundaries**. When you understand outside, **you start understanding your own and other peoples inside**. And that is what gives you power over yourself and makes it easier to learn and **evolve mentaly and emotionaly**. 

## So, what the fuck now? 
So, **you are yourself**, you are productive, **you are constantly exapnding** yourself but it is getting slow. What you realize that is that you are not alone. People thought you stuff, why can't you just reproduce your knowlage and find people who deserve to learn from you? Well, you can. You have knowlage to provide and **you need more horse power** and they need your knowlage and want to improve just like you did and they can provide their time to do what you have no time to do.
